      "The sky appears blue to us due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight reaches Earth'an atmosphere, it interacts with molecules and small particles in the air. Sunlight consists of different colors that correspond to various wavelengths of light. Shorter wavelengths (blue) are scattered more efficiently by these tiny atmospheric particulates than longer wavelengths like red or yellow because they travel as smaller, shorter waves; this scattering process spreads the blue light in many directions and when we look towards the sun, our line of sight passes through a greater volume of atmosphere where it has been scattered. Hence, with more direct path being taken by blues rays from different parts at higher angles around the horizon to us than other colors during daytime under clear sky conditions, this is why Earth's sky appears predominantly blue most of time while sun is up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The effect diminishes towards twilight (before dawn) when there’s less contrast between direct and scattered light due to lower sun altitude in the sky - hence skies turn from a bright or darker shade depending on whether it's daytime, dusk/dawn or night but never green. Also note that at noontime both red and blue could appear nearly equally intense since all colors of sunlight are scattered through Earth's atmosphere before reaching our eyes (though the sky would still likely look more white than any specific color).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you ever wondered why clouds don’t make us see a bluish hue, that's because they act like tiny mirrors reflecting all colors of light back towards the Sun instead of scattering them. Additionally, when there are particles or pollutants in greater amounts (like dust from desert storms), sky might appear more orange/red as shorter blue and green wavelength get absorbed by these larger particulates while longer red rays gets scattered lesser but still reaches our eyes along with the backscattered sunlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, at nighttime when Earth's surface is in darkness due to absence of direct solar light reaching it; skies appear dark as there isn’t enough scattering for us see blue hues and star lights are visible only if they pass through clear or cloudless atmospheres without being scattered.\n"
